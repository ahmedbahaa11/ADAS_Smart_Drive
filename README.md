# SmartDrive

SmartDrive is a project that aims to develop a smart driving system. It includes firmware for various features and peripherals, along with documentation, examples, and tests.

## System Diagram

The system diagram below illustrates the components and their interactions in the SmartDrive system.

## State Machine

The state machine represents the behavior of the SmartDrive system. It describes the different states and transitions of the system during operation.

![State_Machine](images/state_machine.jpg)

The SmartDrive system operates based on a state machine with the following states:

1. Idle
2. ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control)
3. LDW (Lane Departure Warning)
4. AEB (Automated Emergency Braking)
5. LKS (Lane Keeping Support)

The state transitions are as follows:

- From Idle:
    - Transition to ACC state when the ACC mode is enabled.
    - Transition to LDW state when the LDW mode is enabled.
- From ACC:
    - Transition to Idle state when the ACC mode is disabled.
    - Transition to AEB state when a potential collision risk is detected.
- From LDW:
    - Transition to Idle state when the LDW mode is disabled.
    - Transition to LKS state when the vehicle deviates from the lane.
- From AEB:
    - Transition to Idle state when the collision risk is mitigated.
- From LKS:
    - Transition to Idle state when the vehicle is back within the lane.

## GUI

![System GUI](images/gui.png)

The SmartDrive project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. The GUI allows users to monitor the system's status, configure settings, and visualize data in real-time. Some key features of the GUI include:

- Real-time visualization of sensor data such as vehicle speed, distance to objects, and lane position.
- Interactive controls for enabling/disabling various ADAS modes, such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Lane Departure Warning (LDW), and Automated Emergency Braking (AEB).
- Configurable settings for adjusting sensitivity thresholds, warning/alert preferences, and system behavior.
- Graphical representation of the vehicle's trajectory, highlighting detected lane markings and potential collision risks.
- Logging and exporting of system data for further analysis and evaluation.

The GUI is developed using the Qt framework and Python, providing a cross-platform solution that can run on various operating systems. It utilizes the PyQt library for seamless integration of Qt with Python. The GUI module is located in the `firmware/App` directory.

For more information on using and customizing the GUI, please refer to the [Qt for Python Documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/).
